# Student Task: Clean Up This Messy Project Structure

## Your Mission
Transform this chaotic file structure into a clean, organized landing page project.

## What You'll Find Here
- 200+ files scattered everywhere
- Duplicate files with different names
- Files in wrong locations
- Unnecessary backup and temporary files
- Mixed naming conventions
- Case sensitivity issues

## What You Need To Do
1. Identify and remove duplicate files
2. Organize files into logical folder structure
3. Remove unnecessary files (logs, scripts, backups)
4. Apply consistent naming conventions
5. Create a clean, maintainable structure

## Target Structure
```
toko-online-landing/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â””â”€â”€ scripts/ (only if needed)
```

## Tips
- Look for files with similar names but different cases
- Check for duplicate content in different folders
- Remove development/server files that don't belong in a static site
- Group related files together
- Use consistent naming (kebab-case recommended)

Good luck! ðŸš€
